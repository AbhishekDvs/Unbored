# Unbored!
<sub>For when you're bored outta your mind</sub>

#### What do you do when you're bored?
***You find something to do!***

*"Unbored!" is an app where you can generate random ideas of things to do when you're bored with a tap of a button!
You can also filter them out by the type of activity.*

This app was made by my cat while I was ~~**working**~~ sleeping. _Or was it the other way around?_

Here's a few snippets from this Flutter app.

#### I've used the BoredAPI to fulfill this purpose and therefore, a huge shoutout to @drewthoennes [https://github.com/drewthoennes]

Needless to say, this is a WIP and will continue to be for a long time.

Cheers, yo!
